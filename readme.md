# MEAN stack app

This repo contains the MEAN stack application that is built through  Full Stack Training's MEAN Stack course.

========
* build api
* in the course, there's some bug such as after refresh, the login user name is gone.(fixed)
* css file is out of date so remove it.
* Done in most part.
* this is only for mean stack app practise
* store all reviews in hotel model may not be a good idea.

Some take aways:

* after refresh page all data in service is gone.
* interceptor is useful when set up all params before send data to back end.
* factory may good for common methods while service is good for data trans? Just one opinion.
* good structure for each controller factories ... is important.
* jwt is used for gen token and bcrypt is to crypt the password.
